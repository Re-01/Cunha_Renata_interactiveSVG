# About
The idea behind the poster is create something visual for modern mothers that always have problems, or concerns, about simple things to use, or to have in a purse, when they have kids.

The poster shows in a fun way 5 important things that can change a motherâ€™s life when use it, or avoid it.

References: all research were found in Brazilians websites. The most of them was government websites that do research for support their vision, as example the research about if the children should use pacifiers or not.
